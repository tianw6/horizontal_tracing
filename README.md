# horizontal_tracing

This is the 3D centerline extraction algorithm to trace horizontal axon pathways in cross-sectional tissue. 
The MATLAB function Skeleton3D.m was downloaded from MathWorks community. 
The horizontal_tracing.m script traces axonal pathways within the tissue. 
The connect_segment.m function connects two axon segments.
